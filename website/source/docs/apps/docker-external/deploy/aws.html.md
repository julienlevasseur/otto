# Build & Deploy: AWS

On AWS, the "docker-external" application-type starts a single EC2
instance with the Docker container running. This EC2 instance is configured
to not have any public access.

Please see the [general build & deploy page](/docs/apps/docker-external/deploy)
for information on how future versions of Otto will improve deploys
of Docker containers.
