# Otto Commands (CLI)

Otto is controlled via an easy to use command-line interface (CLI).  Otto is
only a single command-line application: `otto`. This application then takes
subcommands such as "dev", "build", or "deploy". The complete list of subcommands
is in the navigation to the left.

Otto's CLI is a well-behaved command line application. In erroneous cases,
a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to `-h` and `--help`
as you'd most likely expect.

To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run `otto` with no
arguments. To get help for any specific subcommand, run it with the `-h` flag.

Each command has been documented on this website. Links to each command can be
found on the left.
