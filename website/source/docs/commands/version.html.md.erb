# Command: version

The `version` command displays build information about the running binary,
including the release version and the exact revision.

## Usage

```
otto version
```

## Output

This command prints both the version number as well as the exact commit SHA used
during the build. The SHA may also have the string `+CHANGES` appended to the
end, indicating that local, uncommitted changes were detected at build time.

## Examples

```
$ otto version
Otto v0.1.0-dev (7881e20f4f9f59ca7e457412766df8b7fab4c16a)
```
