# Command: status

The `status` command displays status information about the state of your
application's development environment, infrastructure, builds, and deploys. It
is a quick way to see what has been built for a given application.

## Usage

```
otto status
```

Otto maintains the information displayed in the status command in a local
cache. This makes the command very fast, but it means that the output may not
reflect the true state of the world in cases where changes are made externally.

In case this happens, you can re-run Otto's command to manage the out-of-sync
component to get it to update. For example, if the development environment has
been shut down externally, but `otto status` reports it as up, just rerun `otto
dev` or `otto dev destroy` to refresh the status.

## Example

```
❯ otto status
==> App Info
    Application:    website (ruby)
    Project:        website
    Infrastructure: aws (simple)
==> Component Status
    Dev environment: CREATED
    Infra:           NOT CREATED
    Build:           NOT BUILT
    Deploy:          NOT DEPLOYED
```
