# Upgrading Otto

When a new version of Otto is released, upgrading Otto is easy:
[download](/downloads.html) the new version and copy it over the old version.

Due to the design of Otto, specifically around having a distinct
compilation step for configuration vs. runtime, the effect of upgrading
Otto is usually minimal. Read the
[backwards compatibility](/docs/install/backwards-compatibility.html)
for full details.
