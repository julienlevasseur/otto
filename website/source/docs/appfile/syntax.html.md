# Syntax

The syntax of Appfiles is [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl).

We show what this looks like below as well as a basic syntax guide. The
actual meaning of the various sections of the Appfile below are documented
in more specific sections that can be found by navigating to the links to the
left.

## HCL

Here is an example of an Appfile:

```
# Application stanza
application {
    name = "otto"
    type = "go"

    dependency { source = "github.com/hashicorp/otto/examples/mongodb" }
}

/*
Let's disable this for now
customization {
    go_version = "1.4.2"
}
*/
```

Basic bullet point reference:

  * Single line comments start with `#`

  * Multi-line comments are wrapped with `/*` and `*/`

  * Values are assigned with the syntax of `key = value` (whitespace
    doesn't matter). The value can be any primitive: a string,
    number, or boolean.

  * Strings are in double-quotes.

  * Numbers are assumed to be base 10. If you prefix a number with
    `0x`, it is treated as a hexadecimal number.

  * Boolean values: `true`, `false`.

  * Lists of primitive types can be made by wrapping it in `[]`.
    Example: `["foo", "bar", 42]`.

  * Maps can be made with the `{}` syntax:
	`{ foo = "bar" }`.
