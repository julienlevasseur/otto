# Appfile

Otto is configured with a text file in the root of your project
named `Appfile`. This section talks about the features, structure, and
syntax of these files.

To learn more about the purpose of Appfiles, please see the
[Appfile concepts page](/docs/concepts/appfile.html). This section
is more of a reference on the available configuration options within
the Appfile.

The Appfile must be named `Appfile` and must exist at the root of your
project. It isn't currently possible to name this file any other name,
and it is a low priority to support such a feature.

Click a sub-section in the navigation to the left to learn more about Appfiles.
