# Foundation Types

Otto supports a range of [foundations](/docs/concepts/foundations.html), which
augment a base infrastructure to provide features like service discovery,
security, and scheduling.

This section documents the foundation types that Otto supports by default. Use
the navigation to the left to read about the available foundation types.

## Future Foundations

Otto 0.1 uses the [Consul foundation](/docs/foundations/consul.html) to make
services easily discoverable in development and deployed environments.  Otto
will add [foundations supporting security and
scheduling](/docs/concepts/foundations.html#future-foundations) in a future
release.
