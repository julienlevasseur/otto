# Otto vs. Other Software

This section compares Otto to other software choices that seem similar
or may overlap with the use cases of Otto.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Otto website, we attempt
to only use facts. If you find something that is invalid or out of date
in the comparisons, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/otto/issues) and we'll
address it as soon as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Otto versus other
software.
