# Example Applications and Dependencies

This directory contains example applications and dependencies. We plan
to have a real website listing popular Appfiles at some point but until
then you can use this.

A future version of Otto will also introducing more strict versioning,
which will allow you to safely lock to these files even if we were to
delete them (because of Git). Otto 0.1 does not contain versioning, however,
so if you're using this in a serious way, you should copy it into your
own repository.
