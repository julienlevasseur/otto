# Basic Ruby Example

This is a basic example of a Ruby application.

It is a **zero configuration** example: there is no Appfile. Just run
`otto compile` and everything will just work.

This application is a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
application. We chose Sinatra to make this example as simple
as possible.
